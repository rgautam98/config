# config
The repository for  some dot files on my machine.  

## .zshrc  
  This is the config file for [zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) and [oh-my-zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/) plugins.  
  For instructions as to how  install zsh and oh-my-zsh on your machine, visit [here](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki).  
  The .zshrc config file can be used with a little tweaks to the alias, as they are specific to my machine.  

## .vimrc and .nanorc  
  These files can be used without making any changes to the them.  
  But be sure to have insalled all the plugins for the vim editor.  
  You can use the config file on your machine, even without the plugins also. Just remove all the line which correspond to the plugins, and you are done.
